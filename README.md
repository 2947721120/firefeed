Firefeed
========

Firefeed is a twitter clone - a web app that lets users post small messages
called *sparks* to their stream. You can follow other users, and their sparks
will now appear on your stream.

The unique property of this application is that it is built entirely using
client side logic - no server neccessary - other than to serve the static
HTML/CSS/JS files, of course.

This is made possible by Firebase. This app will also automatically scale
to how ever many users end up using the site!
